# Instructions

To run this project, please run the following commands in your terminal:

npm install @mui/material<br/>

npm install -S react-router-dom
npm install redux
npm install reduce-reducers

The booklist will initially be empty as redux is being used to store newly added books in localStorage. 

Please see below for some items to use.

The api calls I used for this project use olid's that end in W. I listed a few for you to use for convenience.

Sample OLID's to use to test:
1. OL45793W
2. OL468431W
3. OL63072W
4. OL86318W
5. OL55649W
